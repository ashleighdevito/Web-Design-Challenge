# Web-Design-Challenge

This project was to create a website summarizing findings of the initial four plots from the [Weather Challenge](https://github.com/ashleighdevito/python-api-challenge).

The site utilizes Bootstrap and a CSS style sheet to format.  It is also mobile friendly.

Structure consists of pages depicting:

  * Summary (Landing Page)
  * Plots
  * Comparison of plots
  * Source Data
    
Plots included:

    Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
